# US-Medical-Insurance-Costs

Patients medical records were provided in a CSV file including thier `age` 

In this project, the data has been explored first using Pandas, then extracted and organized for further analysis. A class has been constructed with several methods to analyze the data. Visualization and statistical analyses are provided to test for association between variables.

The **purpose** of the project is to have a better understanding of how different factors in patient medical records contibute to their final insurance cost, and whether one factor is associated with another (in our case, how region is associated with the other factors).
